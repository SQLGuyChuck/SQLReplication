# SQL Server Replication Code Repository
SQL Server Replication information, scripts, and procedures for custom alerting.

##Chuck Lathrope an Author in Tribal SQL
Redgate and MidnightDBA organized a bunch of new authors to create a book on SQL Server topics, called "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tribal-SQL-Tony-Davis/dp/1906434808/" target="_blank">Tribal SQL</a>". I wrote the "Taming Replication" chapter on transactional replication, which covers all aspects of setup, performance, and troubleshooting. The book really covers what each of us authors thought was important tribal knowledge that we are passionate about. The books website is <a href="http://www.tribalsql.com" target="_blank">www.tribalsql.com</a> and all proceeds go to Computers 4 Africa charity.

I hope you enjoy the book, I know I spent a lot of time writing and re-writing the Taming Replication chapter with lots of help from Tony Davis the lead editor.

Cheers,
Chuck Lathrope
